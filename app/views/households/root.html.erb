								<p>Welcome to the Institute for Quality Education’s online scholarship management system! If you have been invited to apply by your child(ren)’s school you will use this site to apply for the Tax Credit Scholarship. This portal will allow you to apply for the scholarship each year as well as track the status of each application you submit.</p>
								<br>
								<p>Before submitting an application your child(ren) must first be either enrolled or currently attending a participating private school.</p>
								<br>
								<h3 class="title">After that...</h3>
								<p>
									Once you’ve submitted your application, your child’s school will review your application and verify your income information. The school will contact you regarding the necessary documentation you will need to provide before the application can be approved. If you have already provided the school with the necessary documentation, you will likely not need to provide any additional information. Your child(ren)’s school will notify you once your application has been accepted. If your child receives a Tax Credit Scholarship, the funds will be sent to directly to the school.
